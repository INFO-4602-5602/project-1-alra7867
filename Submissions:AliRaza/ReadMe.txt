I worked with Vibhor Mishra for this assignment as a group. Thank you.

Work completed: Part I-V 
Bells completed: Tool tips , Xs and Ys , Styling Visualization. 
Whistle completed: Replication

Whistle Replication explanation:
I created a visualization in the Tableau of the Anscombe I data. I created a simple a bar chart graph of both the axis. It was a simple process of creation but after working in D3 for this assignment I feel D3 gives you more authority over your visualization in a way how you want to create them. In Tableau, I was given a defined way of the creation of the graph and was not able to play around more as compared to the D3.

Styling Visualization: I updated the background color to blue because I feel it represent freedom and motivates you. I was originally trying to add paper background but due to time brevity I stop. Paper background takes me to the vintage time, when everything was really simple and smart.
